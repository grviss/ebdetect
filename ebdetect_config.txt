#################### Intensity thresholding ####################
# semi-optional: intensity threshold in (per frame) data units
# Must be set if SIGMA_CONSTRAINT is not supplied. If set, SIGMA_CONSTRAINT will
# be ignored. 
# Defaults: !VALUES.F_NAN. May be a 2-element array.
# INTENSITY_CONSTRAINT = 3000.

# semi-optional: factor to determine the intensity threshold.
# Must be set if INTENSITY_CONSTRAINT is not supplied. If INTENSITY_CONSTRAINT is
# set, SIGMA_CONSTRAINT (and FACTOR_SIGMA) will be ignored.
# Unless FACTOR_SIGMA is set, the intensity threshold is calculated as: 
#   threshold = mean + sigma_constraint * stdev
# Defaults: 0. May be a 2-element array.
SIGMA_CONSTRAINT = [1.55,1.4]

# optional: switch to state that the threshold should not be obtained by
# multiplying SIGMA_CONSTRAINT by the standard deviation, but rather by
# multiplying SIGMA_CONSTRAINT directly with the mean.
# If set, intensity threshold is calculated as:
#   threshold = mean * sigma_constraint
FACTOR_SIGMA = 1

# optional: region over which the mean and standard deviation should be
# calculated. Takes either a string filename of a mask cube or a 4-element array
# [x0,y0,x1,y1]
#REGION_THRESHOLD = 

#optional: switch to indicate that the line center intensity should be taken
# into account. Defaults: 0 (= no)
#LC_CONSTRAINT = 0

# optional: factor to determine the intensity threshold in the line core. 
# The threshold is calculated as:
#   threshold = lc_mean + lc_sigma * lc_stdev
# Defaults: 0. 
#LC_SIGMA = 0

# optional: use running MEAN and STDEV instead of overall values. Takes either a
# string filename with the running mean data cube or a scalar integer to specify
# the number of time steps up and down that should be used in computing the
# running mean. Defaults: 0
#RUNNING_MEAN = 

#################### Size thresholding ####################

# order to be considered the same detection.

#################### Detection grouping ####################
# optional: number of frames that may be skipped to find spatial overlap in
# order to be considered the same detection. The larger the disturbance from
# seeing, the higher the value should be
# Defaults: 0

# optional: maximum number of frames to look for same label. Useful for time
# series spanning more than 2 hours.

# optional: check for merging features. If so, retains the label of bigger
# feature.

# optional: override the merging for certain detections. Takes a 4-element array
# with elements [tlow, tupp, oldlabel, newlabel].

# optional: check for splitting features. If so, bigger feature retains label,
# smaller feature gets new label
# Defaults: 1 (= yes)
SPLIT_CHECK = 1


# optional: save results of bright kernels within detections. Works only if
# SIGMA_CONSTRAINT is a 2-element array, where kernels will be those pixels
# above the highest intensity threshold.
# Defaults: 0 (= no)
GET_KERNELS = 0

# optional: size constraint in number of interconnected pixels for bright
# kernels. Can be only lower limit or lower and upper limit (e.g., 
# kernel_size = [5,10]). 
# Defaults: [0,nx*ny]. Is only used if the GET_KERNELS switch is set.
